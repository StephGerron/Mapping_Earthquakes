# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Basic Project Plan
### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.
### Tasks

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.
### Approach

Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You’ll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you’ll need to create geographical maps.

## Objectives

#### The goals of this challenge:

#### To illustrate the severity of the earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates

1. Use d3.json() to get tectonic plate data and add the data using the L.geoJSON() layer.
2. Style the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map.
3. Add the tectonic plate data as an overlay with the earthquake data.
4. Add a third map style to allow the user to select from three different maps.
